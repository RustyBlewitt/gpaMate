## gpaMate, a web app to provide Griffith University students clarity on their current and trajectory academic standings throughout their courses.
# Created by "Group 12" at the 2018 Griffith Hackathon and received first prize.

# Summary

Created using Ionic to maximise tangibility of concept in the time restricted nature of a hackathon, gpaMate aims to reduce student anxiety and uncertainty of progress throughout the academic year. Beyond this, the web application automates the currently tedious task of accessing course profiles to view assessment pieces, they're weightings and requirements.

During the event, gpaMate successfully accessed the temporarily open Griffith API to demonstrate it's capabilities to the judging panel. The simplicity, scope for real user benefit and utility that this app provides impressed the judging panel and secured first prize for the team.
